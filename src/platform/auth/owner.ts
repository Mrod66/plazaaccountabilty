/**
 * The OWNER role: who holds it, and the two ways to get it.
 *
 *   1. One click from the dashboard (the usual way). The site's owners (the account owner and
 *      members whose role holds `account:*`) press "Open admin" in the dashboard. The
 *      platform mints a one-use, 2-minute ticket and sends the browser to
 *      `GET /site-api/auth/owner?ticket=…`. This site spends the ticket with the platform, server to
 *      server with its Site Key (`POST /api/site/v1/owner-sign-in`), which answers the address and
 *      the CURRENT owner list. The address is signed in (its account is made if it has none: no
 *      password, nothing to register) and holds `owner`. No email, no sign-up.
 *   2. An owner address that signs up here and sets its password through an emailed link (the
 *      reset link proves the inbox AND that this person chose the password). Owner never goes to
 *      a confirmation link alone: anyone can register an owner address first.
 *
 * The owner SEAT (`auth_state.owner_user_id`) is the account the platform's owner list points at.
 * When that account's address is no longer on the list (the account changed hands), the
 * next owner address to sign in takes the seat, and the previous holder loses `owner` (their account
 * and other roles stay). Owners the owner added by hand in Users keep it. Locally and in the
 * Preview, with no owner list, the first account becomes owner (`ownerClaimMode`).
