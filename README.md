# Site — Astro app

A starter for a **website plus its own app**, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) on one
Cloudflare Worker:

- **Pages**: a home page made of sections and an about page (prerendered, served as files), a
  **blog** written as Markdown files (`src/content/blog/`, one page per post), and a **job board** with search and detail pages;
- **accounts of its own**: sign-up with email confirmation, sign-in, password reset, "sign out
  everywhere" — stored in your Site Database, secured with PBKDF2 passwords, short-lived signed
  tokens, rotating refresh tokens and rate limits;
- **roles and permissions**: owner, admin and member out of the box, custom roles, and admin
  screens for users, roles and an activity log;
- a **dashboard** at `/portal` — a React app with [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router)
  and [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query);
- your own **backend** at `/site-api` — a [Hono](https://hono.dev) app every page and screen
  reads through;
- your own **Site Database** — Prisma Postgres, through [Prisma ORM 7](https://www.prisma.io).

One project, one build, one deploy.

## Put it live

Pick **Astro app** when you create a site in the dashboard (or turn on "make it an app"), change what
you like in the editor (or ask your AI agent), then **Publish**.

**Enable the Site Database first.** This project ships migrations; a version with migrations is
refused until the site has a database. The platform gives the live site your account owner's email
at each Publish, so only that address (plus any you add to `ownerEmails` in
`src/server/auth-settings.ts`) can claim the owner role: the first stranger to sign up can't. With
no owner email at all, nobody becomes owner on the live site.

The platform sees `astro` and `@astrojs/cloudflare`, installs with `npm ci`, runs
`npm run build` (`prisma generate && astro build`), applies new migrations to your live database,
then deploys. If a migration fails, the previous version keeps serving.

## What this site controls

| Address | Served by |
| --- | --- |
| `/`, `/about/`, `/blog/`, `/jobs/` | this site |
| `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`, `/rss.xml` | this site (search engines, feed readers) |
| `/account/login`, `/account/register`, `/account/forgot`, … | this site (sign-in) |
| `/portal/…` | this site (the dashboard) |
| `/site-api/…` | this site (your API) |
| `/api/…` | the platform |

## Write a post

Add a Markdown file to `src/content/blog/` (`my-post.md` → `/blog/my-post/`) with a `title`,
`description` and `publishedAt` at the top (see `how-to-add-a-post.md` there), then Publish.

## Accounts

- The **owner** is the first person to confirm an owner email: your account owner's
  email (set by the platform at each Publish) or an address in `ownerEmails`. Locally and in the
  editor Preview, with no owner email, the first person to confirm becomes owner. Owners and admins manage users at `/portal/users` and roles at `/portal/roles`.
- Confirmation and password-reset emails are sent by the platform on your site's behalf.
- Change how sign-up works in `src/server/auth-settings.ts`.

## Running it on your machine

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # set SITE_URL, a JWT_SECRET, and a DATABASE_URL to try sign-in
npm install
npm run dev              # http://localhost:4321
npm test                 # unit tests (auth crypto, tokens, rate limits)
# + integration tests (real Site API on a real Postgres; EMPTIES that database):
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5470/some_throwaway_db npm test
# (The local stack: a Postgres container on port 5470, user and
#  password = SITE_DB_USER / SITE_DB_PASSWORD in api/.env; create the throwaway db first)
npm run build            # the Worker, into dist/
```

`.env` is for your machine only and is git-ignored — never commit it.

## Changing the database

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --create-only --name add_something   # 1. write the migration
# 2. wrap prisma/migrations/<…>/migration.sql in BEGIN; … COMMIT;
npx prisma migrate dev                                       # 3. apply it to the Preview Database
npx prisma generate                                          # 4. the client gets the new model
```

On your own machine these read `DATABASE_URL` from `.env`.

Migrations only move forward: never edit one that was applied, and change tables in steps (add,
fill, switch, drop later). `docs/agent/database.md` has the rules.

## Staying up to date

```bash
npm run platform -- check     # is a newer template release out?
npm run platform -- upgrade   # apply it, keeping your changes (commit first)
npm run platform -- docs      # the platform's latest agent docs
```

Where releases come from: `repo` in `template.json`. Today it is `file:templates/astro-app`, the
template's folder in a platform checkout (there is no published template repository yet):
set `SITE_DIR` to that checkout, or pass `--from <path to templates/astro-app>`. A folder
holds one version, so for a real 3-way merge also pass `--base <a copy of your current
version>`; without it, `upgrade` adds new files, replaces the managed ones and lists the files
you changed for you to compare. A GitHub `owner/name` with `vX.Y.Z` tags works the same way
once the templates are published.
